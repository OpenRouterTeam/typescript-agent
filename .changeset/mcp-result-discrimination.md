Add a `source` discriminant to tool results so untyped MCP tools no longer collapse the type safety of typed tools.

Previously, mixing an MCP tool (whose output schema is `unknown`) with fully-typed tools in one `callModel({ tools })` array collapsed the entire result union to `unknown` — one untyped tool poisoned every other tool's result type.

- `ToolExecutionResult` (and `ToolExecutionResultUnion`) now carry `source: 'client' | 'mcp'`. Narrowing on `source === 'client'` recovers the precise, schema-derived results for your own tools; MCP results stay isolated as `unknown` under `source === 'mcp'`.
- `ToolResultEvent` (streaming: `getFullResponsesStream`, `getToolStream`) gains the same `source` field. **Breaking:** the `tool.result` event payload now includes `source`; consumers that constructed or exhaustively matched these events may need to account for it.
- `@openrouter/agent` exports a `markMcp()` helper, an `isMcpTool()` guard, and the `McpBranded` type. `@openrouter/mcp` brands every wrapped tool (including synthetic `list_resources`/`read_resource`) so the discrimination is automatic — callers just spread `mcp.tools` as before.
- MCP tools continue to execute locally and serialize to the wire as `type: 'function'`; the brand is purely informational and does not change runtime behavior.
